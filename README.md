# Green Eats

A Flutter application for tracking and educating eating eco-friendly or eating green!

# App description: 
The goal of this app is to provide a way for users to conveniently track the environmental impacts of their diet. Users will enter their daily meals and will receive a 0 to 5 star rating based on how environmentally friendly their meal is.This rating will be based off of factors such as meat content, dairy content, etc. Users will then be able to track their points and progress and work towards the goal of environmentally conscious eating.

# Target Users: 
Young men and women who are interested in tracking the environmental impacts of their diet. Mainly targeted towards Gen-Z and Millennials given that climate change is one of the top issues of this generation.

# Features:
	This will be a 3 page application with the pages titled as Account, Meals, and Education.

The main Meal page will function to enter a meal and then get a rating on how environmentally friendly the meal was.
The user can specify their protein, carbohydrate, vegetable, how their food was packaged, where they purchased, and other information.
On the Account page, the user will have an overall rating and a history of meals to see.
The rating would be out of 5 stars, and this gives the user incentive to eat more “green” and share with friends!
On the Education page there will be tips in order to see how they can create a greener diet, and facts about the food industry.
